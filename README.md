Dependencies
------------

You will need to install those packages:

And have VIM version 7.3 In OS X you can install it with brew `brew install macvim`

Also you need to install node.js and npm for install some node packages and
other dependencies.

**Install on Debian / Ubuntu with:**

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm ack-grep ctags

**Install on OSX (I will suggest to use [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)):**

    brew install ack ctags node && curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Once you have installed node and npm install these packages required for some
plugins:

    npm install jslint -g
    npm install less -g

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Macvim is falling to compile with the correct version, it is using an older
one**

Try this: 
    cd /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
    sudo mv Current Current-sys
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 Current

    brew install macvim

    sudo mv Current Current-brew
    sudo mv Current-sys Current
